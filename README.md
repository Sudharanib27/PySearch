# PySearch
Toy Search Engine with TF-IDF
PySearch is a toy search engine implemented in Python. The code reads a corpus and produces TF-IDF vectors for documents in the corpus. Using these vectors, it calculates the cosine similarity scores between a given query string and the documents in the corpus. Finally, it returns the document with the highest cosine similarity score as the query answer.
